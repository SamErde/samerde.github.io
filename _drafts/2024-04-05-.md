This isn't a treatise on agile DevOps. It may even sound like I'm contradicting...

Many aspects of this concept are relevant to writing PowerShell scripts as well. If you step into the deep topic of improving performance of your PowerShell scripts, one of the first recommendations that you will find is to "filter left." Like shift left, this rule can greatly improve the scale and performance of your script by reducing the number of objects in your pipeline to only include what you need. (I'm having flashbacks to The Phoenix Project and the lesson of reducing WIP.) I like PowerShell, so let's look at an example.

This example gets all users and then sends them all to the Where-Object cmdlet to select the ones that are enabled.

```powershell
# Get all enabled users
Get-ADUser -Filter * | Where-Object {$_.Enabled -eq $true}
```

This example gets all enabled users from Active Directory with one command and skips the rest.

```powershell
# Get all enabled users
Get-ADUser -Filter 'Enabled -eq $true'
```

 

Happy learning!

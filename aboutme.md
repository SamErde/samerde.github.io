üëãüèº Hi! My name is Sam Erde. Thanks for joining me here and on Twitter. I'm just this guy that has been blessed with opportunities to work with some amazing people on some really cool technology.

I like Visio diagrams and bulleted lists. Here are some bullets:

I enjoy working with:

- Active Directory
- Defender XDR
- Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)
- Intune
- Microsoft 365
- Microsoft Exchange
- Microsoft Teams
- PowerShell...especially PowerShell!
- IT Infrastructure
- coffee
- puns, dad jokes, and memes

Cybersecurity is in the DNA of all of the above, so I identify closely with a lot of friends in the infosec space, even though I've always held systems/infrastructure roles.

When I'm not working, I enjoy:

- camping and hiking
- kayaking
- basketball
- disc golf
- the ocean
- music
  - ambient
  - classical
  - downtempo and chill-hop
  - jazz
  - metalcore
  - rock
  - folk
  - and just about anything else!
- puns, dad jokes, and memes
- coffee

...but the biggest priority in life are my wife and kids!

More to come as this blog takes shape and I exercise my writing skills. ü´°
